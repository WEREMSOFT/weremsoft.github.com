                    <p><p><b>I</b> was working in open space offices since forever. And always have this feeling that is a really bad idea.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>O</b>pen offices are meant for facilitate interaction between people that works in a project, get everybody plenty of natural light, be able to tell if a person is available just by rising your head, etc.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>I</b>n my case, I always have this problem that I'm trying to concentrate and I have to put headphones to stop listening other people conversations.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>A</b>lso, I had this feeling that "hmmm, maybe I'm a lonely wolf and this is just a symptom of some kind of  antisocial disorder", but I grow up, and read a little more about office spaces I found a consistent line of thinking against the open-plant offices.</p><p><b></b></p><p><h2>What other people says</h2></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>L</b>et's take a quick look to what other people says about open-plant offices:</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>I</b>n the book "Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams", Timothy Lister and Tom DeMarco talks about a test called "Code Wars", where they take programmers from a company and make a competition about programming. Basically, they have to build some software related thing. And as a result of this test, they say: "Top Performers space is quieter, more private, better protected from interruption".</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>T</b>he Joel Spolsky(co founder of Trello), on his article "The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code", shows a list of points used to evaluate your next potential employer. And in the point number 8, says "Do programmers have quiet working conditions?". This comes from several posts on his blog about how open offices destroys productivity.</p><p><b></b></p><p><h2>Why open plan offices are till used?</h2></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>I</b> think there are several reasons that makes this terribles offices still exists:</p><p><b></b></p><p><ul></p><p><li>Institutional Inertia</li></p><p><li>The common idea that open plan offices are cheaper(I respectfully disagree)</li></p><p><li>Defensive Management</li></p><p><li>Regulations(european regulations requires natural light on offices spaces. Easy solution: no walls)</li></p><p></ul></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>J</b>ust to name a few.</p><p><b></b></p><p><h2>Working Alone</h2></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>I</b>n 2016, I was working from home and it was amazing, I was able to concentrate really well, and because of that, projects goes smoothly and extra hours where extremely rare.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>T</b>his was really interesting for me, because I was able to prove this theory about private space for work. Based on this I can totally say that private environment for intellectual work makes a difference in the productivity of the company.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>W</b>orking alone is not the solution, this was only possible because the company I was back then, had a strong culture of working with distributed teams.</p><p><b></b></p><p><h2>Some points to considerate</h2></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>I</b>'ll state a problem, bear with me on this:</p><p><b></b></p><p><hr></p><p><b>1</b>. Addition is acumulate two values.</p><p><b>2</b>. Multiplication is a succession of additions</p><p><b>3</b>. Power is a succession of Multiplications</p><p><b>4</b>. Subtraction is an adition (negative is a property of the number, not of the operation)</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>T</b>hink in a way to express the square root of a number in terms of additions.</p><p><hr></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>N</b>ow, having this problem in your mind. Can you solve it, in your mind, on your actual working environment without headphones?</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>A</b>s a programmer, I'm sure you face a lot of challenges like this(equivalent in complexity) on your everyday work, and, the key here is not if you are able to solve it or not, the important here is HOW FAST you can solve it.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>A</b>lso, think that, if you solve your problems faster, crunch time shouldn't be necessary.</p><p><b></b></p><p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>I</b> wonder how, in this world where every company is looking to improve productivity, still create environments where the people that does intellectual tasks, don't have control over the privacy of their working environment.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>I</b>'m not talking about solve this problem using dynamite on the actual offices or make work form home universal(I like the idea though), but creating spaces where people can take their computer and have some quiet place to work.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>M</b>aybe having a place where you can think more clear, can lead to better ways to work, better solutions, and an overall improvement on the quality of life.</p><p><b></b></p><p><h2>References</h2></p><p><b></b></p><p><a href="" target="_new"></a></p><p><b></b></p><p><a href="https://books.google.cz/books/about/Peopleware.html?id=TVQUAAAAQBAJ&source=kp_cover&redir_esc=y" target="_new">"Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams" - Timothy Lister and Tom DeMarco</a></p><p><b></b></p><p><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/" target="_new">"The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code" - Joel Spolsky</a></p></p>
