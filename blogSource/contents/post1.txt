I take the desition of deleting my old posts. I was a little rusty writing and some of them look like a rant. This new year I want to start it with a fresh look over my projects.

Hi, I'm Pablo Weremczuk, I was working for a lot of cool companies in the last years. I become a digital nomad(kind of) 2 years ago with the objective of see the world, ispired by people like <a href"https://twitter.com/natashathenomad">@natashathenomad</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/RamiroBazan">@RamiroBazan</a>.

It wasn't easy, getting off a stable job and looking for new horizons is a frigtening experience, also sometime you have to go back to get an employer to reach your life goals, but the goal I set to myself on my birthday of 2015 was "travel more".

And I did!! Since my birtday #38 I was in New York, Miami, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Poland and Austria.

I was working with a broad range of technologies, like Apache Cordoba, PHP, AngularJS, Angular2, nodeJS, Swift, Android, and other technologies I never heard about.

I had the chance to move to the USA or Europe, and I choose the last because fits more my way of thinking regarding quality of life.

So, In this new year(2018!) I'll try to write better, more meaningful posts by reconnecting myself with my old passion of building things that works(videogames specially!!).

It was really hard to move to Europe from Argentina, but I worth it. Last year was a whole adventure, like looking at the life of somebody else on Netflix. And I'm living this 2018 as the second season of this series of my new life.

So, thanks for passing by, sorry for my terrible english, enjoy my adventures as much as I do, and, over all, live your own.

Gracias!
