All of us remember some inspiring quote from Steve Jobs or someone else about fulfilling your dreams. Personally, I found this speeches from some successful personality really inspiring. My favorites are Bill Gates, Richard Branson and Elon Musk(the great).

But, time to time, something on their talk doesn't seems right to me. Specially on big company CEO's. They seems to say that "Money is not important, follow your dreams and everything will make sense in the end". Also, they said that they found success on life thanks to drop formal education.

<h2>Some historical and economic insight</h2>

Keep in mind that by the time Seve Jobs, Bill Gates and other big people that shapes our present started their careers , the world was in its <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/08/60-years-of-american-economic-history-told-in-1-graph/261503/">best shape regarding economic growth</a>. This allows normal people to take more risk. So they can try different stuff.

<h2>So, the world has changed</h2>

The world is different now, and this advices don't make much of a sense.

Also, keep in mind that all the successful CEO's of the wold are not even the 0.001% of the population. That means that you have more chance of winning the lottery than to create the next Apple.

<h2>Money is important</h2>

Money is important because a long list of aspects. You can't take care of your loved ones or yourself if you don't have certain ammount of money.

Also, as a long term project, having a house is important. If you don't have a home. You'll pend a lot of money on rent related issues. So try to solve this issue as soon as possible. If buying a home is not possible in your country, move to somewhere else.

<h2>Back to the speeches</h2>

As I said, I don't like this speeches, not only because they tell you to take easy on money, or drop the formal education, but also because I think that there is a conflict of interests on those words.

<h2>Conflict of interests</h2>

Steve Jobs, Mark Sukerberg, other random billonary guy with jeans and snickers. All of them have one point in common. They have companies that pays salaries. And a lot of people that will love to work on their companies. So they have a very strong interests on capitalize those facts by paying small salaries to the privileged ones that want to work in those places.

So, what is their advice for you? Don't think about the money, work hard!!!

<h2>My own experience</h2>

I had the dream to become a videogame developer, I wanted to become and INDIE videogame developer. Some kind of modern Stephen King that works everywhere, writing, creating and having and awesome life.

So, first I leave the highly profitable banking industry (for half of the salary!) and then I make my own game on my spare time. That's how my game "Vox Populi, Vox Day: A werewolf thriller" was born.

I was young and inexperienced, so I take very little action to promote and make profit out of my game. I made some bucks, but not enough to buy a house. Actually, not even enough to buy a car!

It was a though year, working 4 hours a day after my 8 hours job. At the end of the year I was exhausted and finish the game(spoiler alert) with a starwareske "to be continued".

Times goes by and I was unable to create the second part. I just was unable to see the point for that huge effort.

<h2>My advise</h2>

As a dream chaser, I have to tell you a couple of things:

<h3>Make your dreams sustainable</h3>
First, and most important, YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR DREAMS SUSTAINABLE. You have to be able to work in your dreams for long time. Chasing your dreams is not a sprint, but a marathon that will extend for the rest of your life. The only way to make that happen if by making your dreams sustainable, which means, profitable. So be sure that every thing you do is not for free, except maybe help another fellow in the same situation that you.


<h3>Make a product, not a project</h3>

You can work in a project, an open source javascript framework, a game engine, whatever. It's nice to have a project where you can learn safelly and, don't get me wrong, big things have been achieved working like this. But having "just" a project have some problems. A personal project doesn't force you to face real world problems. Like solving some complex problem within a deadline, or in a cost effective way.

So, avoid doing projects for free, without deadline. Choose instead freelance project. They are much more intense and teach you more stuff besides technical things, like how to talk with people.

<h3>Keep an active and healthy internet presence</h3>

It's really important to keep an internet presence active. Bogs, linkedin, twitter, youtube. All that medias talk of you. Be sure to be correct, ethic and helpful. Mind what you say and the impact on your image. This helps to create awarness of your products and personal growth.

<h3>Save for the rainy days</h3>

Buy a home is not the only important thing you can do with money. You need to have a safety net for any unexpected situation. Toxic environments are everywhere and you have to be ready to leave a place and be without working for a while if you need it. Believe me that have this freedom is way more important that having the latest video game console.

If you are going to buy something expensive, make this question to yourself "In the last two years, how many situation I was where having this product make my life easier or contribute with my personal growth?" if the answer is "very few or none" you don't need the damn thing.

Also, keep in mind that "Fist you save, then you spend". Never the other way around, so don't trust in black fridays or sales.

<h3>Invest on education</h3>

Books and online courses always leave you to new interesting and exiting paths. If you can always prioritize the formal education, specially on your 20's.


<h2>Final words</h2>

Your dreams are important, but you will forget them early on life if you don't keep them sustainable.

Motivation is the ability to see the purpose on what you are doing. So keep them with purpose.

Don't be foolish, and don't starve.
