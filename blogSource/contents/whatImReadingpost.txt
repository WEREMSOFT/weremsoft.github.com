Here I will compile a list of the books I am reading. Some take longer than others and I usually read several at the same time.

<h2>2D Apple Games by Tutorials</h2>

2D games are all about show sprites, move them, listen the user actions and playing sounds. This games shows that and also the problems that you can face working on native-2D-Games for IOS. The images needed to work in the game, are hidden deep in the prolog(not near the first tutorial, where you expect to find a link).

Besides that, the book is good, amazing if you want to start with simple tasks like showing and image in screen. After the basics, the book goes deeper in IOS game programming.


<h2>Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams</h2>

This is an amazing book that compiles all that is wrong in the companies nowadays. From open space offices to defensive management. I still didn't finish it, but has amazing ideas. I totally recomend this book.

<h2>IOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</h2>

Another amazing book. Teachs IOS programming with well explained tutorials. At the end of every chapter you end up with a working app like the ones that you need to build to apply for a job(<a href="https://github.com/inaka/iOS-exercises" target="_new">example</a>).
Very well writen, the code doesn't have any error, everyting is explained at the right level of detail. Not too much, not to little. I think is the best book out there for people that want to do the transition from web development to IOS development.

<h2>Swift Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</h2>

It's an easy to read book, but is very basic for my taste. You can totally skip the first chapters.

<h2>The Algorithm Design Manual</h2>

Super technical book, I start reading it after I was rejected from my interview at google. It shows algorithms and it's implementations. It explains a lot, but it's really hard to understand. It's one of those books that you need to code to get it. I don't know if some day will have the time to finish it.

<h2>Tom Bartel's Blog</h2>
<a href="https://www.tombartel.me/" target="_new">Tom Bartel's blog</a> has really good articles about management. Even if you are not pursuing that professional carrer, it helps a lot to understand how to sail the political waters of the companies.

My favorite posts are <a href="https://www.tombartel.me/blog/strategies-master-difficult-conversations/" target="_new">"Strategies to master difficult conversations"</a> and <a href="https://www.tombartel.me/blog/how-to-prepare-one-on-one-five-minutes/" target="_new">"How to prepare one on one on five minutes"</a>.
